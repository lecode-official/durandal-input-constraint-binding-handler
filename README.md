# Durandal Input Constraint Binding Handler

A Knockout binding handler which applies constraints to HTML text inputs. This binding handler is made to be used in conjunction with the Durandal SPA application framework. Since the Durandal framework is no longer being actively developed and has been superseded by Aurelia, this project is also no longer active.
